# EPID674_00_Base_Project

This repository installs packages that are relevant for the class: EPID 674 "Epidemiologic Data Analysis in R". This project should be established in Posit Cloud as a "base project" so that subsequent projects will have the relevant packages installed.

## Files and descriptions:

EPID674_00_Base_Project.Rproj --\> This is the R project directory containing relevant files.

Install_packages.qmd --\> This is the quarto markdown file containing the code to install relevant packages for the course.

## Instructions:

1.  Prior to each semester, run the code in the "Install_packages.qmd" file.

2.  Update the project settings in Posit so that the access is open to everyone in the class.

3.  Then in the class workspace, set this project as the "base project". Whenever you install a new project, remember to set this as the base project.
